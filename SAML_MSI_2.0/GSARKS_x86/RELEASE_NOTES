Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------
1. The Installer does not validate the port number for 'Google SAML bridge for Windows'. User needs to enter a valid non-conflicting port during installation. Assigned port number could be changed even after Installation directly through IIS Manager.
2. The Installer does not validate the 'Artifact Consumer' URL on "Google SAML Bridge for Windows - Configuration Wizard".
3. Cancelling Installer does not initiate rollback of the installed components. You need to run installer again in 'remove' mode to clean up the installed components.
4. Google Search Resource Kit for SharePoint and Google SAML bridge for Windows, if concurrently installed on the same machine, might encounter with error messages.
5. After uninstallation, aspnet_client folder will still exist in saml-bridge-for-windows folder for MOSS 2007 installation on 32-bit machine with IIS 6.0
6. Need to select Remove or Repair manually during the Uninstallation.
7. Sometimes an error message(unable to parse incoming SOAP message: SAML exception: Could not validate input xml against schema:..) will be encountered in the Authorization logs, if Google Search Box for SharePoint is not deployed on all WFE.
8. If the 32 bit installer is executed on 64 bit machine, then the installer does not give any error message.
