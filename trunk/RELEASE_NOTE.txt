RELEASE NOTES FOR SAML BRIDGE

version 2.0
Since GSA 6.4, the legacy SAML AuthN SPI is replaced by Security Manager SPI. This version is compatible with GSA 6.4 Security Manager based SPI.
It also supports Bulk Authorization feature.

Problems Fixed:
Issue #11, decode request failed (fixed in 1.5.1)
Issue #12, Support Batch AuthZ
Issue #16, SAML Bridge 1.6 or lower is not compatible with new Security Manager SPI in GSA 6.4

version 1.5

Summary:
This version was built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. There are quite some differences in the binary output. If you are upgrading, you need to clean up the 
existing folders and copy over the new ones.
If you'd like to build from source code, you'll need Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. Previous releases were built using Visual Studio 2003.

Problems fixed:
#8, Saml Bridge throws an exception when performing an authz check on a folder/directory. Now SAML Bridge checks file's ACL instead of trying to open a file or folder.
#9, Saml Bridge throws an exception when performing an authz check on a file in use 

Features added:
Version 1.5 allows error pages or error codes to be used when something goes wrong. For example, some applications use IIS plugin so that when user is not authorized, 
he/she will be redirected to an error page. Previous versions couldn't detect this type of denial. Now you can configure the SAML Bridge to recognize such permission
denial.
